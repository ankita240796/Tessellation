# Tessellation

Code to generate the tessellating patterns for irregular shaped objects.

This is done by converting the irregular shape into any polygon suitable for tessellation.
For this purpose following methods are employed :

* PolyDP.py : Ploygon approximation done using defined functions
* ADSS.py : ADSS is generated from a set of points and then ploygon approximation is done from the given set of ADSS
